From product innovation to governance, Element has consistently proven its ability to ship and lead. I want to be a large contributing member of the community.  I started working and supporting Element in the fall of last year across all things such as seeding pools, providing feedback on products, as well as commenting on documentation.\n\nThis is only the beginning of Element Finance. Fixed rates and fixed rates products are pillars in the financial and economic system of the world so I believe there is a large opportunity for their suite of products to find product-market fit.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nWeb3 Qualifications / Skills (optional)\n\nI've been in Crypto since 2015 (with BTC mining and ATMs).  In 2017, I participated and contributed to the DeFi space with early projects like 0x Project and Kyber Network, then again with the resurgence of DeFi in 2019 (1st money in Compound and Curve).\n\nProjects I've worked with include:\n\nKeep Network and Pocket Network = node runners\n\nOndo Finance, Element Finance, and Curve/Compound = bootstrapping liquidity\n\nTokemak, Redacted Finance, Vesta Finance = Go-to-market and token launch plans/modeling\n\nWeb3 Skillset:\n\nIncubation —> tokenomics design, industry contacts for legal, taxes, compliance\n\nLive trading/DeFi —> bootstrapping LP\n\nExchange listing / Market Making contacts\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nAreas of Interest\n\nTreasury management\n\nThe typical DeFi DAO has too large of a concentration of their native token. This is an issue. We need to efficiently and effectively balance their holdings. With my network of DAO leaders and liquid fund managers, I would be able to facilitate OTC deals as well as post-deal active treasury management.\n\nProtocol improvements\n\nElement's suite of products is definitely not the easiest to understand/use.  I think this is a low-effort but high-reward UX/UI design problem that we could solve through user testing.\n\nMy go-to source of information is documentation (aka docs).  And I believe that Element's docs require some love and I'm ready to give it to them.\n\nStrategic initiatives\n\nAs a DeFi native, I am a super fan of composability and hyper liquidity.  Element's PT tokens could act as the defacto savings account of DeFi.  I would lobby and push to have PT tokens as collateral on key lending protocols.\n\nFor example, why could we not mint PT tokens for a UST fixed term pool using the UST3CRV LP tokens.  Then collateralize those PT tokens to borrow USDT, swap for UST, then deposit the UST onto Anchor for additional yield.",

Great to meet you all.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEthereum Address : justinbram.eth (0xAf98Bb4bCeD00A17fFE020499C342CFC3511Fb10)\n\nDiscord Handle : Justin Bram#3452\n\nTwitter Handle : @justincbram\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStatement of Intent\n\nI am incredibly passionate about DeFi, and I currently work on several different DeFi protocols as a founder, advisor, and multisig member. I'm especially excited about the opportunity to work with the Element community as I've been engaged in the Element ecosystem since I first covered it on my YouTube channel last July. I believe that Element can serve as a core building block for DeFi, and I would love the opportunity to help shape Element's governance.\n\nWeb3 Qualifications\n\nI've been working full-time in crypto for over two years now. I'm currently building a capital-efficient lending market called Astaria with my co-founder Joseph Delong. Before that, I led growth at Ondo Finance. My work involved partnering with 14+ other DAOs and growing TVL to over $100m. I also serve as a multisig for several other DeFi protocols and have a large YouTube channel that focuses on educational DeFi content. I covered Element on my channel and interviewed Windra last July.\n\nAreas of Focus :\n\nTreasury Management\n\nDeFi protocols are notoriously bad at treasury management. Most DAO treasuries consist of roughly 90%+ of their native token. This is not healthy for DAOs & projects, which should be building all-weather portfolios that allow for future growth regardless of market conditions. This is a major use case for Element's fixed yield product itself and something that I would like to help design internally for Element's DAO.\n\nEducation\n\nMy YouTube channel serves as a hype-free, educational resource for DeFi users. I also have a large, educational Discord community. I enjoy helping others learn about and experiment with DeFi and would love to bring this to the Element community.\n\nStrategic Initiatives\n\nI helped lead partnerships during my time at Ondo and would love to help with DAO-to-DAO relations at Element. I think I can add significant value by helping Element partner with other DAOs.",

I believe that Element Finance has incredible potential, an amazing product, and the right team to succeed in their vision. I am impressed with Element Finance and aligned with their vision for crafting a more collaborative and flexible financial environment for users and developers in DeFi. I would be honored to take an active part in this journey as a delegate.\n\nMy Background / Qualifications / Skills\n\nI am an early investor in the idea of ‘Blockchain’ having acquired my first $ETH in 2015. Ever since, I have remained an avid supporter and user of blockchain technology, in specific DeFi applications.\n\nI solidify my own beliefs and vision for the space by joining like-minded teams on their journeys. I work very closely with Rarestone ’s portfolio projects on refining their commercial, technical and token economic strategy. My speciality lies in analyzing and optimizing the game-theoretic components for aspiring decentralized protocols. More recently, I have taken on the role of Head of Strategy at Advanced Blockchain AG , a German-based public company that builds and invests in blockchain companies.\n\nAdditionally, my passion and the potential I see within this technology drives me to be deeply involved in the portfolio companies of both Rarestone and Advanced Blockchain AG. As a candidate I see myself adding value in all aspects of the protocol as I have a well-rounded background in the development, strategy, operations, growth, and sustainability of DeFi projects.",

When I found what blockchain can do, about 2years ago I knew this will change the whole world. People will retain their onwnership about their data, attentionment and money.\n\nHowever, we just come to the door of web3, and a lot of new changes we have to face. I spent most of my time in the last year to try new things on chain, DeFi protocals, NFTs, DAOs, so I know the difficult part of Web3 is collaboration in communities. While blockchain is believed to be a kind of trustless tech which is becoming the basic of Web3, we need even more trust and groupwork to build DAOs than ever, since people in collaboration creat value not anything else. Somneone call working in a DAO \"governing mining\", but I will prefer call it \"community building mining\".\n\nI have been trying to do this in some DAOs, like DODO exhange, Goldfinch Finance, Metamask Forum. I went to learn ,use, vote and discuss and give suggestions about the products and governance. I am also a user of Element Finance, so I am exciting to have a chance put my feet in this adventure. Governing in a new way is a creative try for DAOs and Element deserve respect. I will try to do my best in the community if I have get allowce to join the GSC.\n\nThanks.",

But I quit in the end of 2020, when the upstream oil price plummeted, the centralizated world played the tricky game again, mergers and the economic restructuring afterwards. I knew about the blockchain a few years ago but I stood outside the threshold until I quit my previous industry, God opened a new door for me, and from 2021, I became an enthusiast in this emerging industry and enjoyed this journey very much. I call it:\n\nMy journey in the centralized world is over and my journey in the decentralized world has just begun.\n\nIt has been around half a year since I became an Element protocol user, Usually, “participate in the protocol, join the community, and if any idea comes up, contribute to the community” is how I participate in the protocols, and I am also rewarded, sometimes even big surprise. And I have a strong sense of joy when I see my friends get rewarded because of my sharing.\n\nI usually don’t raise my hand to talk, as I was taught from very young age and my previous industry experience to listen, think and talk less, even I had a western education. But when I feel I am needed, I stand out.\n\nOver the past year, I’ve attended a large number of POAP recorded events, I never appeared on the stage, I guess the POAP team used to think I was a “farmer”. I was a Top 2 POAP collector in the world for a period of time. The journey with POAP and Gitcoin and other eth-core project benefited me, unlike some friends who I ever came into contact, who had been immersed in altcoin trading since their entering this industry and most of them gained nothing and some even lost money. But I got to the real decentralized world.\n\nI read all the words above for application, the “An introduction to Element’s Governance Model”, and watched the video, I have to admit that I was inspired. I now want to go a step further to dive deeper, to learn, and build with you.\n\nI believe the journey has just begun and we will bring more to each other so there will be a better world, a better Element and us in the future. Thank you all.\n\nWeb3 Qualifications / Skills (optional)\n\n·      Proactive participants for almost all the existing and emerging chains and protocols\n\n·      Early passionate participants and early governance participants for the influential projects such as: Uniswap/dYdX/ENS/Sushiswap/Paraswap/Cowswap/Gearbox/RSS3/Balancer/AAVE, Cosmos and etc.\n\n·      RabbitHole Level 6 Adventure Badge holder\n\n·      Web3 Project Galaxy Meta Cowboy: Revolution, Dr.SOL, Galaxy Girl and Reindeer NFT holder\n\n·      ETHrank score: 710\n\n·      High Activity donor to Gitcoin\n\n·      Bankless/Coingecko/Earnifi member…\n\nWhat areas you would like to focus on as a delegate, such as (but not limited to):\n\nActually, I am interested in all the 5, but my first step would be to focus on Governance experimentation.\n\nThank you for your time, no matter my application will be accepted or not, I shall feel happy on my today’s move.",

ETH was excavated in 2018, There are many encryption enthusiasts like me around, And I also run a community, There are about two thousand people, They pursue freedom, equality, like me, And that's what appeals to me about Element Finance, It shows me the real devolution of power, Let everyone have the opportunity to participate and govern, Therefore, I come to apply for GSC representatives and candidates. I am willing to share Element Finance with friends around me, so that more people can understand it, and they have a certain professional foundation. They are early users of DEFI, such as UNI, AAVE, etc., and they are also NFT enthusiasts, and now they are working hard in the field of WEB3.0 and DAO. I believe that the participation of these people will have a positive impact on Element Community, and I hope I can contribute to Element Community.",

A lot of projects are declaring they are moving towards decentralization but I don't believe they are actually going to implement it. right now the governance mainly focuses on the token the community members they hold, but it is highly affected by the whales. Another issue of this voting system is the low participation rate sometimes. We need to find out a more attractive and efficient way to encourage all the community members to get involved in governance.That is what I see in element and I truly believe it. I really want to be part of it and witness the future.\n\nReason why I want to become a delegate/GSC Member: As I talked above since element is going to get all community members to be involved in governance, and there are so many new comers to crypto so I want to convey the voice of these people. I THINK I know them better.\n\nWeb3 Qualifications / Skills:\n\nActive contributor in the following DAOs/Communities: 996DAO co-founder,PIP contributor, Yield examiner , RabbitHole (RH) content Pod\n\nRelevant Works/Proposals:create various education materials and help them to get to truly understand defi and element this amazing project. actively engage with the community and grow it stronger.",

It is important to understand that when we invest, in most cases we are supporting other people who start their ideas.\n\nThat the highest degree of financial development correlates with more wealth for society. That the markets allow us to coordinate much better. That this coordination is necessary to advance and create value as a society\n\nWhen we work to create a project like Element we are improving the financial world and with it our society, it is not a mere exercise in speculation. Element is a protocol that allows risk sharing with different agents to delegate in the agents that can afford it..

The viewpoint is unique and never blind. If Element's governance model works, it will be unprecedented and will definitely force other projects to follow. It's a great thing.

Although I don't discuss it much as with many folks in the space I started off my career in finance, mostly machine learning for lending models. I can confidently say, at least from that experience, that most of what is happening in tradfi is pretty much made up based on outdated historical legacy.\n\nAt the same time, I think DeFi has a lot of potential but needs to mature both in terms of the kinds of products it offers and the incentives + models for governance it uses to manage them. I believe Element is a GoodTM step forward in the sense that it's put a lot of thought and care into both, in ways that I believe can help advance standards for the space and help us make changes to the existing system faster, with more credibility.\n\nStatement of Intent\n\nThe Element protocol has been a needed Lego brick in the broader DeFi primative landscape. As I have pointed out before, fixed rates and interest rate swap markets are a crucial component of well functioning financial systems around the world. For DeFi to achieve what we all believe it can a protocol like Element will be needed.\n\nThat said we’re still very much in the infancy of DeFi in general and the Element protocol in particular. In these early days it will be crucial to establish a set of processes for how the protocol is governed, and to define the standards by which GSC members are held. As one of the earliest members of the Element community and an investor in Element Finance I bring a unique perspective that will be valuable as we chart a course for Element as a decentralized protocol. Through my experience as as one of the eleven elected Emissaries for the Echelon Prime Foundation (a decentralized Play-to-Earn ecosystem) I know what it takes build solid foundations that will outlast those of us who first serve on the council.",

My View & Vision : As an early user who entered the blockchain in 2015, I have witnessed various changes and the shape of blockchain development. From the earliest consensus development of various public chains to ETH's smart contract and the gradually developing dapp ecosystem, from Earn to Build, now we have finally touched the most promising proposition - WEB3.0 . The development of web3 will inevitably merge web2, thus creating the Lego of Defi, the fusion of the Metaverse, the various forms of X-earn. Bringing fixed rate protocols to the blockchain is essential, just like Element. We can combine various tools such as Metaverse, Defi, NFT to complete the puzzle of web3 and create a new financial paradigm.\n\n2. The reason why i wanna be a Delegate and a Candidate for the GSC：Only in the form of Dao can we break through the restrictions of regions, national boundaries and concentration of power, participate in and build a decentralized and successful community Dao. This is a great exploration and I am very excited to be a part of it and contribute to the development of Element.\n\nWeb3 Qualifications / Skills：\n\n 1. Crypto VC Partner\n\n2.

How to mobilize the enthusiasm of community members and let each member actively participate in community governance is a big problem, and how to avoid excessive centralization of the community and lead to the result of large players controlling the agreement is also worthwhile conseidered by every crypto project. Element does not implement community governance by issuing tokens like other projects, but has created a unique model, which is a brand new innovation in the currency circle. I am very excited about this and hope to be able to join such an interesting and professional team. In governance activities, I hope to grow and explore together with element to achieve true decentralized community governance.\n\nWeb3 qualifications/skills: Active contributors to the following DAOs/communities: across protocol rss3 dydx\n\nI am more interested in the Governance experimentation and am looking forward to joining Element Finance governance.",

Mommy, am I really that much of a tryhard?)\n\nDiscord Handle: _Nick#0010\n\nTwitter Handle: @0x_Nick_\n\nStatement of Intention:\n\nFrom the moment Charles posted “ An Introduction to Element’s Governance Model ” I knew that Element will be so much more than “just” a fixed rate protocol. (Which itself of course is super juicy already. I’m coming for you, ePyvcrvSTETH-1YEAR. Tax free yield/discount hopping from yearly term to yearly term will be real. At least in Germany.)\n\nBack to topic. Delegating ones voting power was always something I missed in EthFi (recent exceptions exist i.e. ENS). That is something I thought was pretty cool in the Cosmoverse, where validators can vote on behalf of their delegators. Over time however I noticed that the latter are not always really interested in governance discussions and their voting power can easily exceed their level of informed decision making. Additionally I also think that “ Governance benefits from a shared diversity of opinions and backgrounds ”, which is not necessarily the case with only node operators.\n\nThat - and so much more - is something the GSC structure can do better. I envision a system in which everybody can participate at their own capabilities, but at the same time still remains efficient with a continued high level of diversified decision making at its core.\n\nThat is also the reason why I would be delighted to take a more active role in Elements’ governance and represent some of you other elves. Not only to help shape the Elfiverse but also to push forward new governance innovations.\n\nI can’t confidently share such spectacular web3 resumes as others, but I can guarantee that I’m a solid degen at heart without being braindead. I spent quite a lot of time in Cosmoverse governance decisions (Cosmos, Sifchain, Osmosis) and would claim to be pretty solid in helping to converge different opinions to acceptable outcomes. That’s also a key area I’d like to focus on as a delegate. In that context I’d also like to concentrate on governance experimentation. I think I would also do a good job in contributing to strategic initiatives.\n\nbtw , shortly after the announcement I have secured the domains elfiverse.eth and elfiversefund.eth for us. Just in case they become of interest. If yes, those will of course be donated when the necessary structures are in place. It goes without saying that this is not related to me getting any votes or not. I’ll become a part of the elves either way.",

The Echelon Prime Foundation is building a decentralized Play-to-Earn ecosystem. Our $PRIME token will be utilized by games and tools within the ecosystem, starting with Parallel TCG. Parallel is an NFT based trading card game.\n\nCogent (hopefully!) writer who has published on a variety of topics within the broader crypto space. You can find my writing here: https://medium.com/@0xbewdev\n\nStatement of Intent\n\nThe Element protocol has been a needed Lego brick in the broader DeFi primative landscape. As I have pointed out before, fixed rates and interest rate swap markets are a crucial component of well functioning financial systems around the world. For DeFi to achieve what we all believe it can a protocol like Element will be needed.\n\nThat said we’re still very much in the infancy of DeFi in general and the Element protocol in particular. In these early days it will be crucial to establish a set of processes for how the protocol is governed, and to define the standards by which GSC members are held. As one of the earliest members of the Element community and an investor in Element Finance I bring a unique perspective that will be valuable as we chart a course for Element as a decentralized protocol. Through my experience as as one of the eleven elected Emissaries for the Echelon Prime Foundation (a decentralized Play-to-Earn ecosystem) I know what it takes build solid foundations that will outlast those of us who first serve on the council.\n\nCrucial issues that will need to be tackled from the start include:\n\nEstablishing a constitution or charter by which we as potential GSC members can be held accountable\n\nDetailing standards for operational items such as grant requests, Council compensation, on-boarding new treasury management partners, and community communication such as weekly newsletters, office hours and more formal community calls\n\nIdentifying strategic partners who can work with the GCS to build out new and novel user facing applications on top of the Element protocol\n\nIf elected I will operate as a proxy for Yunt Capital. As early investors, protocol users and community members we collectively are deeply invested in the success of the Element protocol. As crypto native degens, rolling up our sleeves and getting right into it with protocols we invest in is in our DNA. We are no strangers to bootstrapping governance with our partners and are excited to bring our breadth of experience, expertise and connections to the Element GSC. Finally, many of the core values of the Element protocol such as eagerness to experiment and a passion for building inclusive community mirror our own closely held ethos at YC. With this in mind we’re grateful for the opportunity to continue to help shape a protocol we love and ask for your consideration when deciding how to delegate votes for GSC!",

As an early community member, contributor and friend I’ve been privileged to see the growth of the team and protocol.\n\nAs a result of my observance and continued involvement my candidacy brings me to the next viable step in further providing value and realizing the long term self-sustainable vision for the Element Finance Protocol.\n\nCurrently I am the Head of Product and Co-founder at Component, we serve as a Web3 R&D company building tools, products and protocols specifically with blockchain data. We’ve previously launched the “Yield Token Compounding” tool and will continue contributing to Element.\n\nIn regards to my values, I follow core principles to a fault around integrity, brutal honesty, rationality and critical thinking. Immense responsibility keeps it important to hold myself to these standards. But I also make sure to not take myself too seriously all the time so I can have fun .\n\nObjective:\n\nElement Finance’s fixed rate protocol will extend the bounds of our current DeFi market with an obvious inclination towards more risk-averse strategies from TradFi. In reality, for large scale adoption and for good faith regulator engagement, governance itself needs to be resilient, well organized, operated efficiently and end-to-end systematic. These goals are idealistic, but require extensive experimentation and implementation in order to slowly but surely be worked towards for self-sustainability. This increases my belief that Council Protocol’s architecture and given modularity is a true gift to the governance stack.\n\nMy interests in terms of involvement as a GSC member are the following:\n\nGovernance Experimentation\n\nCollaborating to build out frameworks and possibly an environment for Element governance experimentation.\n\nExperimentation and research to further governance automation and security.\n\nOperations\n\nBootstrapping and organizing proper operational structure for aspects such as compensation, accounting, compliance, communication and contribution.\n\nGrants Program\n\nInitializing a grants program strategically around the growth of the protocol network and benefit of community members.\n\nSupporting any grantees and community builders.\n\nTreasury Management\n\nInvolvement in modeling treasury management frameworks in collaboration with 0xBew (Yunt Capital) and other interested parties.\n\nIn conclusion, I plan to spend a substantial amount of my time contributing to the legwork and continuing needs to reach governance and protocol excellence.\n\nFeel free to reach out to me if you have any questions regarding my application or anything Element 😊.\n\n*Disclaimer - as an executive member of Component, Inc. I will uphold impartiality towards any proposals put forth by my party in the future*",

Likely not very useful in matters of tech, but have done a fair share of multisig'ing, DAO operational work, community and FUD combat (not quite the Bruce Li, but aspiring to be).\n\nElement Finance team (and soon DAO) are huge brains, and I'd love to somehow be in this journey and help shape it. Whether I'll be able or not is yet to be seen.\n\nWould most likely be fit for strategy / treasury / governance topics. Not enough brains to access risk in onboarding assets or protocol architecture, but will keep an eye out.\n\nPS: James is cool. His proposal is above.",

At the beginning of contact, this Things are very complicated, but as I went deeper, I began to like this field, but with the development of cryptocurrencies and the increase in the projects I participated in, various problems began to emerge, and I also tried to find a better To solve the problem, many loan projects or mining dex in the market help users provide a mining platform, but there is a problem, it cannot achieve a constant fixed annual interest rate, and for users, it is impossible to follow The same fixed annual interest rate platform as a bank, but element can be realized. At the same time, large-scale funds will be the main customers in the future, and large-scale funds customers are more risky and conservative. Personally, I don’t have much time to participate in more projects, but I am going to participate in element, because I think that developing AMM for principal token may be a more correct approach than pendle. At the same time, it has launched a business line of \"treasury management\". Any defi protocol or dao can make low-risk investment! This means unlimited potential for the future!\n\nMy web3 qualifications/skills:\n\nI think I can help in different areas.\n\nI am an early user of uniswap, and served as a community mod in multiple dex such as kanaswap. I am the highest contributor in the jediswap community, and I have also served as the admin helper of nfts such as voiceserver. Participated in early testing of gearbox.\n\nI've been using the Element protocol since the beginning and sharing it with our crypto square community and sending suggestions as I do so.\n\nAs a heavy user of Element, with the improvement of the protocol, we will serve community users well, help to screen in-depth customers and maintain them, and educate early users.\n\nAt the same time, I have participated in the construction of dao. I think the problem that element's dao construction should be avoided: not everyone who joins the server is a member of DAO, nor should it. Different levels of community participation have different privileges and expectations, which are harmful to the community to confuse them. Some want to participate in will, while others are looking for full-time employment. Some join the casual, while others aim to unravel the thorns of decentralized governance. Therefore, team leaders should be clearly convened to identify a single-responsibility approach to implementation. These leads are Team Champions, Workflow Leaders and Project Managers. They are not responsible for themselves, but they are the core and key coordination point for the cessation of responsibility. This is also the responsibility of GSC members, I think it is necessary to think about how to be a mature and efficient dao, as you can see, most of the dao represent inefficiency.\n\nI have studied CPA and frm, and have certain risk awareness and financial awareness.\n\nThanks for your time and look forward to helping with this amazing project.",

Being involved in multiple DAOs it has been a privilege to not only interact with the community, but to experiment and take in the adhered governance model(s). However, as we've seen lately majority of \"traditional\" (pioneering) DeFi protocols have experienced a sense voting power centralization amongst active, community thought leaders. With the emergence of meta-governance, veTokens, and now Element Finance's Voting Vault primitive, we can begin experimenting towards a true decentralized and community-orient & owned future. Ultimately, my goal is to be a true community representative/steward that directly reflects community sentiment(s), thoughts of experimentation & exploration, and overall fairness.\n\nReason why I want to become a delegate/GSC Member:\n\nIn my opinion, Element Finance is the next DeFi \"money lego\" imperative, while the GSC model is the next DeFi \"governance lego\" imperative - both of which converge towards introducing a cohesive, conducive, and scalable protocol & community.\n\nWeb3 Qualifications / Skills:\n\nIntroduced Meta-Governance model over at Blockchain Education Network\n\nActive contributor in the following DAOs/Communities:\n\nAmpleforth\n\nPieDAO\n\nFurucombo\n\nUniswap\n\nOrigin\n\nRabbitHole (RH) MetaGovernance Pod\n\nCult DAO\n\nFormer DeFi Pulse DAO Partnerships Lead\n\nRelevant Works/Proposals:\n\nUniswap Governance Renovation\n\nThe Proliferation of Meta-Governance Structures\n\nPieDAO Proposal: USD++ Revamp\n\nAmpleforth Proposal: Fixed Yield $AMPL\n\nI'm excited to see the deployment of Element Finance's Governance and can't wait to see what the future has.
